Virtual Environments:

Eliminates issues wrt backwards compatability in different
versions of a package that we need to install

Example:
Project 1 --> VENV-1 --> Fastapi v1.2.1

Project 2 --> VENV-2 --> Fastapi v2.4.3

Now downloading the newer version of Fastapi be a problem

Select the terminal dropdown in the menu at the top of the
create a new terminal then change the type from powershell to cmd
(note this is simply a preference, you can use powershell)

Now we need to open the terminal and make sure we're in the correct 
directory. Then , in the erminal, type py -3-m venv <name-we used venv>

This will create a new series of folders and files

Go to view from the menu, select command pallete
Search python select interpretrer and type the path
to the python.exe file, which in this case is :
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe

Now make sure the terminal is also running the same VENV.
Do so by running the activate.bat file.
type into the terminal venv\Scripts\activate.bat
And you'll see the parenthetical name of the virtual environment

Then type uvicorn main:app in the terminal 
and it will give you a running link,
follow the link to see what's happening.

If you run this with uvicorn main:app --reload
The webpage will refresh everytime you save the.py file,
otherwise you'll have to save and restart the server.

NOTE: 
fast api is really useful for easily changing things to JSON

the decorator "@app.." turns what the function is doing to an 
actual path operation

If you don't change
