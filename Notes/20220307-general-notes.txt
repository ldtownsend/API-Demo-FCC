Path Operations
Your API is just a bunch of path operations

@app.get('/')
def root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to my API"}

"@" is a decorator
"app" a fast api instance
".get()" is a method, an http method
"'/'" is the url or path
"def root()" is the path operation function, which give the user
    some information when they go to that path

Reference for determining the appropriate http function to use:

Reminders: 
Get the terminal back on the venv with venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Then to get the application running with uvicorn main:app --reload
